# pygame-workshop
An interactive, simple tutorial to make a game with Python using pygame

## Setup

### Install Python

- [Official Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setup your development environment

1. Open a new project in your IDE (like VSCode)

2. Open a terminal in your project directory

3. Setup a virtual environment
    1. In your terminal, while in the project directroy, run `python -m venv venv`.
        - This will create a new folder called `venv` in your project directory
        - This folder will contain the python packages, like `pygame`, you install for the project
        >If you get an error, try running `python3 -m venv venv`

    2. Then, activate the virtual environment by running the activation script
        - MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
        - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install pygame by running `pip install pygame`

5. Create the python file for the game!
